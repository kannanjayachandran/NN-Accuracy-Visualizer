# Neural Network Accuracy Visualizer

</div>

### This is a simple application that visualizes the accuracy of a neural network I have created to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. Code for the neural network is available at [Neural network from scratch](https://github.com/kannanjayachandran/ML-Models/tree/main/Handwriting%20Recognizer)

### The application is built using the Streamlit library. The link to the application is [here](https://kannanjayachandran-nn-accuracy-visualizer-app-q4u6eo.streamlit.app/)

### App usage

- Enter a number between 0 and 42000 in the text box, this would be the index of the image in the MNIST dataset; then the image would be displayed along with the predicted label and the actual label.

### To do

- Clean up the code and UI
- Track the accuracy of the neural network over time and display it in the app as a graph
